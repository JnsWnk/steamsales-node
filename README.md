## Steamsales 

This is a proof of concept project and runs for free.
The repository holds the backend part of the project and was built with Node.js.

# The Idea

The idea of the site is to enter a Steam ID and get the whole wishlist of games.
For each game, this site should scrape key sites for the cheapest available key.
The whole list should be displayed with the steam price, discounts and the best key.
However, there exists no keyseller that offers its data publically or via an api.
So i built a backend that uses puppeteer to scrape the keys.
This process however is very slow and unreliable, so this project never left the prototype phase.
Without paid proxy servers its not feasable to scrape on a large and reliable scale.

You can still check out the code and leave suggestions.
